Packaging Examples
==================

These packaging examples are intended to provide a guide to packagers to
promote consistency across multiple operating system distributions.

They packaging is intended to be helpful rather than prescriptive and you will
probably want to remove any compatibility macros and customise according to
your distribution's packaging policy.

The packages are regularly built using the Open Build Service but not
installed and tested:
