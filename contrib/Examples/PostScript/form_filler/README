Hi Tez,

that time I had continued my trials and I made a simple sample solution
based on asciiprint.ps. It is 67 lines in the sample.
This small program can be used to print, for example palatte labels on a
postscript printer (as we are production company :) ).

(See attached file: form.ps ) (See attached file: table.csv )
The way to use it on windows simply:

copy barcode.ps + form.ps + table.csv \\printserver\print /b

Parseline can be extended to read more columns easily.
Printform does all the drawing with the variables coming from the current
row.
It seems to be the cheapest bulletproof solution to print simple forms with
barcode from csv.

I feel it fully customizable.


Yours sincerely,

Janos Juhasz
