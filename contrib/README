Welcome to the script repository for Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript!

It contains a collection of useful scripts which demonstrate some of the 
various ways of making use of the PostScript.

Users of the project are encouraged to submit (via email) any code that 
interfaces with the PostScript barcode writer since this will help to make 
the project accessible to non-PostScript developers.
